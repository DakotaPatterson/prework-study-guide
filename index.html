     <ul>
      <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
      <li>Doctype is a declaration that is not case-sensitive like HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Style defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
      <li>Base defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
      <li>Link connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
      <li>Meta defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li>HTMl is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
     <li>Examples of these elements are text elements, image elements, header elements and list elements.</li>
     <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
     <li>Examples of these elements are meta-related elements, content division elements and semantic elements.</li>
     <li>The headers are organized in order from h1 to h6</li>
     <li>P element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
     <li>The ul, ol and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
     <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
     <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage.</li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Theyâ€™re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>  
          <li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier. </li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>If we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>
